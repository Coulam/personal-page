# Welcome to my website!

*I'm Joe Coulam, a front end developer and digital designer from Nottingham.* 

Here you'll be able to see how I've put together my portfolio. Please bear in mind, I'm constantly finding new ways to update my website, and I'll be tinkering with it now and again to try new things out.

## Current version:
* I'm using React, with Next.js to create server side rendered content
* My content is hosted on Wordpress, I'm using the latest version of WP API and ACF
* Redux and Thunk is used to handle these asynchronous API requests
* The design was put together in XD, Illustrator and Photoshop (and a few other bits and pieces)
* I'm also trying out Storybook to try out UX component testing

If you have any other questions please don't hesitate to send me a quick email!
